Methods can be included here in two ways 

- by submitting information and metadata about the method through a form
- by contributing the software for the method to a software registry

Ideally you would submit the method to the software registry first, and then link to the software in the meta data submission.

## Meta data registry

Submit a new method using the form below

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://forms.office.com/e/2WpKRWVv6N" target="_blank" role="button">Submit a new method</a>
