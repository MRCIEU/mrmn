Welcome to the OpenMR project. This is a community created registry of statistical methods that aims to ultimately enable more reliable causal inference in Mendelian randomisation studies.

Submit a new method to the registry using the form below, and also see the [software](software.qmd) page on how to improve accessibility of your software.
