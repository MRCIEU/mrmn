# MR Methods Network website

## Scope

- Static site
- Search / browse MR methods
- Form to contribute new methods
- Visualisation of methods
- About page
- Simulation results


## Notes

### Forms

- Currently using Microsoft Forms
- Need to manually download the xl spreadsheet and use generate.r to convert for use on website
- Potential to embed on static site

Alternative approaches

- https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor - this allows creation of forms from json schema, need to figure out if it can be used on static website, e.g. https://observablehq.com/@a10k/hello-json-editor
- https://www.staticforms.xyz - emails form
- https://jsonforms.io/ - richer schemas defined by json including rules - need to figure out if it can be used on a static website
- Quarto has forms extension https://github.com/jlgraves-ubc/forms


### Comments

- Each post has a comments section enabled by https://utteranc.es

### Data tables

- Using https://rstudio.github.io/DT/ to display list of methods
- Can also generate a post for every method. Potentially offer two different views of the data
